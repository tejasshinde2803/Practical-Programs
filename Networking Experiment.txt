Experiment-1

Aim: Study of following Network Devices in Detail 
• Repeater 
• Hub
• Switch
• Bridge
• Router 
• Gate Way

Apparatus (Software): No software or hardware needed.

Procedure: Following should be done to understand this practical.
1. Repeater: Functioning at Physical Layer.Arepeater is an electronic device that receives a signal and retransmits it at a higher level and/or higher power, or 
                    onto the other side of an obstruction, so that the signal can cover longer distances. Repeater have two ports ,so cannot be use to connect for more 
                    than two devices

2. Hub: An Ethernet hub, active hub, network hub, repeater hub, hub or concentratoris a device for connecting multiple twisted pair or fiber optic Ethernet devices 
together andmaking them act as a single network segment. Hubs work at the physical layer (layer 1) of theOSI model. The device is a form of multiport repeater. 
Repeater hubs also participate in collision detection, forwarding a jam signal to all ports if it detects a collision.

3. Switch:Anetwork switch or switching hub is a computer networking device that connectsnetwork segments.The term commonly refers to a network bridge that 
processes and routes dataat the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI model. Switches that additionally process data at thenetwork layer (layer 3 and above) are often 
referred to as Layer 3 switches or multilayerswitches.

4. Bridge: A network bridge connects multiple network segments at the data link layer (Layer2) of the OSI model. In Ethernet networks, the term bridge formally means 
a device that behaves according to the IEEE 802.1D standard. A bridge and switch are very much alike; a switch beinga bridge with numerous ports. Switch or Layer 2 
switch is often used interchangeably with bridge .Bridges can analyze incoming data packets to determine if the bridge is able to send thegiven packet to another segment 
of the network.

5. Router: A router is an electronic device that interconnects two or more computer networks,and selectively interchanges packets of data between them. Each data packet 
contains address information that a router can use to determine if the source and destination are on the samenetwork, or if the data packet must be transferred from one 
network to another. Where multiple routers are used in a large collection of interconnected networks, the routers exchangeinformation about target system addresses, so 
that each router can build up a table showing the preferred paths between any two systems on the interconnected networks.

6. Gate Way: In a communications network, a network node equipped for interfacing with another network that uses different protocols. • A gateway may contain devices
 such as protocol translators, impedance matching devices, rate converters, fault isolators, or signal translators as necessary to provide system interoperability. It also 
requires the establishment of mutually acceptable administrative procedures between both networks. • A protocol translation/mapping gateway interconnects networks 
with different network protocol technologies by performing the required protocol conversions.


Experiment-2

Aim: Study of different types of Network cables and practically implement the cross-wired cable and straight through cable using clamping tool.

Apparatus (Components): RJ-45 connector, Climping Tool, Twisted pair Cable

Procedure: To do these practical following steps should be done:

1. Start by stripping off about 2 inches of the plastic jacket off the end of the cable. Be very careful at this point, as to not nick or cut into the wires, which are inside. 
Doing so could alter the characteristics of your cable, or even worse render is useless. Check the wires, one more time for nicks or cuts. If there are any, just whack the 
whole end off, and start over.

2. Spread the wires apart, but be sure to hold onto the base of the jacket with your other hand. You do not want the wires to become untwisted down inside the jacket. 
Category 5 cable must only have 1/2 of an inch of 'untwisted' wire at the end; otherwise it will be 'out of spec'. At this point, you obviously have ALOT more than 1/2 
of an inch of un-twisted wire.

3. You have 2 end jacks, which must be installed on your cable. If you are using a pre-made cable, with one of the ends whacked off, you only have one end to install - 
the crossed over end. Below are two diagrams, which show how you need to arrange the cables for each type of cable end. Decide at this point which end you are 
making and examine the associated picture below

Experiment-3

Experiment-5

Aim: Study of basic network command and Network configuration commands.

Apparatus (Software): Command Prompt And Packet Tracer.

Procedure: To do this EXPERIMENT- follows these steps:
In this EXPERIMENT- students have to understand basic networking commands e.g ping, tracert etc.

All commands related to Network configuration which includes how to switch to privilege mode and normal mode and how to configure router interface and how to 
save this configuration to flash memory or permanent memory.

This commands includes
• Configuring the Router commands
• General Commands to configure network
• Privileged Mode commands of a router 
• Router Processes & Statistics
• IP Commands
• Other IP Commands e.g. show ip route etc.

ping:
ping(8) sends an ICMP ECHO_REQUEST packet to the specified host. If the host responds, you get an ICMP packet back. Sound strange? Well, you can “ping” an IP 
address to see if a machine is alive. If there is no response, you know something is wrong.

PC>ping 192.168.1.2

Traceroute:
Tracert is a command which can show you the path a packet of information takes from your computer to one you specify. It will list all the routers it passes through until 
it reaches its destination, or fails to and is discarded. In addition to this, it will tell you how long each 'hop' from router to router takes.

nslookup:
Displays information from Domain Name System (DNS) name servers.
NOTE :If you write the command as above it shows as default your pc's server name firstly.

pathping:
A better version of tracert that gives you statics about packet lost and latency.

Getting Help
In any command mode, you can get a list of available commands by entering a question mark (?).
Router>?
To obtain a list of commands that begin with a particular character sequence, type in those characters followed immediately by the question mark (?).
Router#co?

configure connect copy
To list keywords or arguments, enter a question mark in place of a keyword or argument.
Include a space before the question mark.

Router#configure ?
memory Configure from NV memory network Configure from a TFTP network host terminal
Configure from the terminal
You can also abbreviate commands and keywords by entering just enough characters to make the command unique from other commands. For example, you can abbreviate the show
command to sh


Configuration Files
Any time you make changes to the router configuration, you must save the changes to memory because if you do not they will be lost if there is a system reload or 
power outage. There are two types of configuration files: the running (current operating) configuration and the startup configuration. Use the following privileged mode 
commands to work with configuration files.

Experiment-17

Aim: Performing an Initial Switch Configuration

Objectives
 Perform an initial configuration of a Cisco Catalyst 2960 switch.

Background / Preparation
In this activity, you will configure these settings on the customer Cisco Catalyst 2960 switch: 
 Host name 
 Console password
 vty password
 Privileged EXEC mode password
 Privileged EXEC mode secret  IP address on VLAN1 interface 
 Default gateway
Note: Not all commands are graded by Packet Tracer.

Step 1: Configure the switch host name.
a. From the Customer PC, use a console cable and terminal emulation software to connect to the console
of the customer Cisco Catalyst 2960 switch.
b. Set the host name on the switch to CustomerSwitch using these commands.
Switch>enable
Switch#configure terminal
Switch(config)#hostname CustomerSwitch

Step 2: Configure the privileged mode password and secret.
a. From global configuration mode, configure the password as cisco. 
CustomerSwitch(config)#enable password cisco
b. From global configuration mode, configure the secret as cisco123. 
CustomerSwitch(config)#enable secret cisco123

Step 3: Configure the console password.
a. From global configuration mode, switch to configuration mode to configure the console line.
CustomerSwitch(config)#line console 0
b. From line configuration mode, set the password to cisco and require the password to be entered at
login.
CustomerSwitch(config-line)#password cisco
CustomerSwitch(config-line)#login
CustomerSwitch(config-line)#exit

Step 4: Configure the vty password.
a. From global configuration mode, switch to the configuration mode for the vty lines 0 through 15.
CustomerSwitch(config)#line vty 0 15
b. From line configuration mode, set the password to cisco and require the password to be entered at login.
CustomerSwitch(config-line)#password cisco
CustomerSwitch(config-line)#login
CustomerSwitch(config-line)#exit

Step 5: Configure an IP address on interface VLAN1.
From global configuration mode, switch to interface configuration mode for VLAN1, and assign the IP address 192.168.1.5 with the subnet mask of 255.255.255.0.
CustomerSwitch(config)#interface vlan 1
CustomerSwitch(config-if)#ip address 192.168.1.5 255.255.255.0
CustomerSwitch(config-if)#no shutdown
CustomerSwitch(config-if)#exit

Step 6: Configure the default gateway.
a. From global configuration mode, assign the default gateway to 192.168.1.1.
CustomerSwitch(config)#ip default-gateway 192.168.1.1
b. Click the Check Results button at the bottom of this instruction window to check your work.

Step 7: Verify the configuration.
The Customer Switch should now be able to ping the ISP Server at 209.165.201.10. The first one or two pings may fail while ARP converges.
CustomerSwitch(config)#end
CustomerSwitch#ping 209.165.201.10
Type escape sequence to abort.
Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 209.165.201.10, timeout is 2 seconds:
..!!!
Success rate is 60 percent (3/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 181/189/197 ms
CustomerSwitch#

Reflection
a. What is the significance of assigning the IP address to the VLAN1 interface instead of any of the Fast Ethernet interfaces?
b. What command is necessary to enforce password authentication on the console and vty lines?
c. How many gigabit ports are available on the Cisco Catalyst 2960 switch that you used in the activity?
